ExcelR Data Science Assignment No 12

## Naive Bayes Algorithm :
  * Naive Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems.
  * It is mainly used in text classification that includes a high-dimensional training dataset.
  * Naive Bayes Classifier is one of the simple and most effective Classification algorithms which helps in building the fast machine learning models that can make quick predictions.
  * It is a probabilistic classifier, which means it predicts on the basis of the probability of an object.
  * Some popular examples of Naïve Bayes Algorithm are spam filtration, Sentimental analysis, and classifying articles.
  
### Each algorithm of Naive Bayes expects different types of data.
  * GaussianNB → When you have continuous features.
  * CategoricalNB → When you have categorical data.
  * MultinomialNB → Applied to text data.
